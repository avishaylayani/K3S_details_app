# Suggestions

### Project

Great work on project structure

### README
Great work on description, links, dependencies and setup.

### INSTALL SCRIPT
You are mixing shell and bash syntaxes, which will make the maintanence of the project `setup.sh` kind of hard in future. Lets talk if you do not know the diff.
- why not use clear url ?
- why not to encode the key/secret 
- Why not use jenkins as key/secret holder ?
- Why not use registry (nexus/harbor/jfrog) as key/secret holder ?
- why not use aws as key/secret holder ?
- why to delete the values file ? just want to know logic, not because i said so...

### Helm
